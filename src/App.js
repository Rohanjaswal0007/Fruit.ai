          <h2>A Brief History of Fruits</h2>
          <p>
            Fruits have played a key role in the diets of humans and animals for millions of years. Historically, fruits
            were considered natureâ€™s candy, sweet and nutritious, providing essential vitamins and minerals to early
            humans. Here are some key points:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fruits were originally foraged from wild plants.</li>
            <li>Apples have been cultivated for over 4,000 years.</li>
            <li>Bananas were domesticated in Southeast Asia and are now a global staple.</li>
            <li>Oranges were first cultivated in China and later spread to Europe and the Americas.</li>
          </ul>
